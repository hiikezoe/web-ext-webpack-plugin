# web-ext-plugin

A webpack plugin for running web-ext

## Basic usage

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev web-ext-plugin

# Or for yarn
$ yarn add -D web-ext-plugin
```

**webpack.config.mjs**

```js
import WebExtPlugin from 'web-ext-plugin';

module.exports = {
  plugins: [new WebExtPlugin({ sourceDir: 'extension-dist' })],
};
```

Running `webpack` by itself will build the extension, effectively running
`web-ext build` on the output of your Webpack build.

To run the extension in a browser (including automatic reloading when using
Firefox), i.e. to run `web-ext run`, you will need to start Webpack in watch
mode using `webpack -w`.

## Options

- `args` (optional) - Array of additional CLI options passed to the browser
  binary.

- `artifactsDir` (optional) - The folder where artifacts are built stored.
  Defaults to `<sourceDir>/web-ext-artifacts`.
  You typically won't need to alter this.

- `browserConsole` (optional) - A boolean indicating if the browser console
  should be shown on load.

  Defaults to false.

- `buildPackage` (optional) - A boolean indicating if a zip file of the
  extension should be generated.

  The name of the .zip file is taken from the name field in the extension
  manifest unless `outputFilename` is set.

  Defaults to false.

- `chromiumBinary` (optional) - A path to a specific version of a Chromium
  browser to run. The value is an absolute path to the browser executable or an
  alias string.

- `chromiumProfile` (optional) - A path to a custom Chromium profile to use.

- `devtools` (optional) - A boolean indicating if DevTools
  should be shown on load. Requires Firefox 106 and later.

  Defaults to false.

- `firefox` (optional) - A path to a specific version of Firefox to run.
  The value is an absolute path to the Firefox executable or an alias string.

- `firefoxPreview` (optional) - Turn on developer preview features in Firefox.
  This option accepts multiple values, although it currently only supports the
  `mv3` value, which is also the default value.
  The mv3 value allows developers to test their extensions with Firefox
  Manifest Version 3 support (without having to manually flipping the related
  preferences).

- `firefoxProfile` (optional) - A specific Firefox profile to use.
  This may be either a profile name or the path to a profile directory.
  If this is not set a new profile is generated each time.

- `ignoreFiles` (optional) - A list of glob patterns to define which files
  should be ignored. If you specify relative paths, they will be relative to
  your `sourceDir`.

  By default, without the use of `ignoreFiles`, the following rules are applied:

  - Any file ending in `.xpi` or `.zip` is ignored
  - Any hidden file (one that starts with a dot) is ignored
  - Any directory named `node_modules` is ignored

  When you specify custom patterns using `ignoreFiles`, they are applied in
  addition to the default patterns.

- `keepProfileChanges` (optional) - A boolean value indicating if the profile
  specified by `firefoxProfile`.

  Defaults to false.

  See the notes for the [`--keep-profile-changes`
  flag](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/web-ext-command-reference/#web-ext-run)
  from the `web-ext run` documentation.
  Specifically, this should not be used together with a profile you later use
  for browsing.
  It is, however, useful if you want to force the profile in a specific location
  to be written to (e.g. for testing out-of-disk space situations).

- `noInput` (optional) - If `true` disables all features that require standard
  input.

  Defaults to `true` in watch mode and `false` otherwise.

- `outputFilename` (optional) - The name of the .zip file to write when
  `buildPackage` is true.

  If this is not set the name of the .zip file is taken from the name field in
  the extension manifest.

- `overwriteDest` (optional) - A boolean value indicating if the package built
  when `buildPackage` is true, should overwrite an existing package at the same
  location.

  Without this option, web-ext will exit in error if the destination file
  already exists.

  Defaults to false.

- `pref` (optional) - A dictionary to customize any Firefox preference without
  creating or modifying the profile.

- `profileCreateIfMissing` (optional) - A boolean value indicating if the
  profile specified by `firefoxProfile` should be created if it does not
  exist.

  Note that if this is specified, `firefoxProfile` is treated as meaning a
  directory path (not a profile name).

  Defaults to false.

- `runLint` (optional) - A boolean indicating if `web-ext lint` should
  be run as part of building the extension.

  Defaults to true.

- `lintWarningsAsErrors` (optional) - A boolean indicating if lint warnings
  should be treated as errors. Only applies if `runLint` is true.

  Defaults to false.

- `ignoreKnownChromeLintFailures` (optional) - A boolean indicating whether lint errors known to fail when trying to check a chrome extension should be ignored. Only applies if `runLint` is true.

  Defaults to false.

- `filterLintFailures` (optional) - An array of objects that will be used to selectively ignore lint errors that match. An example of these objects looks like this:
  ```
  {
    code?: string;
    message?: string;
    file?: string;
  }
  ```
  If any of the fields are present, they will be matched against linter errors found and will be used to remove them.
  If multiple fields are present in the object, they will be treated as an "and" condition, allowing specific errors to be ignored.
  Only applies if `runLint` is true.

  Defaults to [] (empty array).

- `selfHosted` (optional) - If `true` declares that your extension will be
  self-hosted and disables lint messages related to hosting on
  addons.mozilla.org.

  Defaults to `false`.

- `sourceDir` (optional) - The folder where webpack is building your extension
  to.
  Typically this will be where you have configured `output.path` to point to.
  Relative paths will be resolved relative to the `webpack.config.js` file.

  Defaults to the same folder as the `webpack.config.js` file.

- `startUrl` (optional) - A URL or array of URLs to load on startup.

- `target` (optional) - One of `firefox-desktop`, `firefox-android`, or
  `chromium` or an array of such values.

  Defaults to `firefox-desktop`.

  See the documentation for the `--target` option of [`web-ext run`](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/web-ext-command-reference/#web-ext-run).

### Android-specific options

These options only apply when `target` includes `firefox-android`:

- `adbDevice` (required) - Connect to the specified adb device name.

- `adbBin` (optional) - Specify a custom path to the adb binary.

  Defaults to assuming `adb` executable is in `PATH`.

- `adbHost` (optional) - Connect to adb on the specified host.

  Defaults to being discovered automatically.

- `adbPort` (optional) - A string that specifies the port adb will connect to.

  Defaults to being discovered automatically.

- `adbDiscoveryTimeout` (optional) - Number of milliseconds to wait before
  giving up.

  Defaults to `180000` (3 minutes).

- `adbRemoveOldArtifacts` (optional) - If `true` it will always remove old
  artifacts files from the adb device when it exits.

  Defaults to `false`.

- `firefoxApk` (optional) - Run a specific Firefox for Android APK. Example:
  `org.mozilla.fennec_aurora`. If unspecified and there is only one available,
  it will be selected automatically.

- `firefoxApkComponent` (optional) - Run a specific Android Component.

  Defaults to `<firefox-apk>/.App`.
